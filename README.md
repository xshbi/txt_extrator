## Setting up a Virtual Environment

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xshbi/txt_extrator.git
   
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd txt_extrator
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment. Run the following command based on your operating system:

    - For Windows:

        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```

    - For macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - For Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - For macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    Your command prompt should now show the virtual environment name, indicating that it's active.

## Installing Dependencies

1. Install Tesseract:

    - For Windows, download and install the executable from [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install the necessary Python packages, including `pytesseract` and `opencv`.
